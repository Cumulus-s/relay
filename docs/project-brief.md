# Architecture Brief

Cumulus Relay is an agent-auth and signup platform. It gives AI agents a
standard way to discover products, sign users up, read verification email, and
invoke product actions with user consent.

This repository contains both the hosted Relay service and the self-hosted
version. A startup can either connect to hosted Relay or fork this repository
and operate its own Relay deployment.

## What Relay Does

Relay has four core jobs:

1. Publish provider metadata that agents can understand.
2. Authenticate users, developers, and agents.
3. Run signup workflows that may need email verification.
4. Dispatch signed action webhooks to integrated products.

The hosted service keeps Relay as an API business. The open-source server lets
teams audit the system, self-host it, and adapt it for their own stack.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Web app | Next.js App Router |
| API | Hono mounted at `/v1/*` |
| MCP | Streamable HTTP MCP at `/mcp` |
| Database | Postgres with Drizzle ORM |
| Workflows | Vercel Workflow DevKit |
| Auth | email OTP, passkeys, sessions, bearer agent tokens |
| Billing | Stripe |
| Email | Resend outbound, SendGrid inbound parse |
| Observability | Sentry and pino |
| Tests | Vitest |

## Auth Model

Relay uses separate auth paths for separate actors:

- people sign in with email OTP or passkeys
- browser sessions use signed cookies
- agents use bearer tokens scoped to a user or tenant
- integrated products receive HMAC-signed webhooks
- public keys are exposed at `/.well-known/jwks.json`

Agent tokens are shown once and stored only as hashes.

## Provider Model

Relay supports two provider types:

- built-in providers operated by the Relay deployment
- tenant-defined providers registered by startups that integrate Relay

Provider metadata includes display name, homepage, docs URL, categories,
pricing model, capabilities, and input schema. Agents use this metadata to pick
the right product for a user's request.

The hosted business can operate built-in provider integrations as cloud
services. Self-hosted operators can remove, replace, or add providers.

## Public Surfaces

Relay exposes:

- REST API under `/v1/*`
- MCP tools under `/mcp`
- OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`
- public JWKS at `/.well-known/jwks.json`
- human dashboards under `/me` and `/dev`
- package creator through `create-cumulus`

## Development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

For database setup, apply migrations from [migrations](../migrations) to a
Postgres database and set `DATABASE_URL`.

## Licensing

The Relay server is AGPL-3.0-only. The npm integration packages and small
hosted SDK-only starter templates are MIT-licensed. Generated full, inner, and
self-hosted templates include the Relay app/server and default to
AGPL-3.0-only.
