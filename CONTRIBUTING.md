## Pull Requests

- Use a short imperative title.
- Explain what changed and why.
- Include verification commands.
- Update docs when behavior, env vars, APIs, or setup change.
- Do not include secrets, private strategy notes, local worktree notes, personal
  filesystem paths, or generated `.env` files.

## Cumulus DB Templates

`packages/create-cumulus/templates/cumulus-db` is copied from the public
Cumulus DB service. Preserve its AGPL-3.0-only license files, NOTICE file,
tests, and smoke script when refreshing it.

Generated app code must talk to Cumulus DB through HTTP/token APIs. Do not
import `apps/cumulus-db` source into MIT generated app code.

## Migrations

When schema changes:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." npx tsx scripts/apply-pending-migrations.ts
```

Keep migrations deterministic and review generated SQL before committing.

## Security

Report vulnerabilities privately through the process in `SECURITY.md`.
