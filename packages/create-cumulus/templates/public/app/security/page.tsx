        Relay sits between AI agents and third-party APIs and stores
        credentials on your behalf. Every design decision here optimizes for
        keeping those credentials out of attacker hands without making the
        product unusable for agents.
      </p>

      <Section title="Encryption at rest">
        Every credential column (third-party API keys, tenant webhook signing
        secrets, pending-account credentials) is encrypted at the application
        layer with <b>AES-256-GCM</b>. Each ciphertext carries a 12-byte
        random nonce and a 16-byte authentication tag. The master key is a
        32-byte secret stored in deployment environment variables and never
        logged or committed. A {`key_version`} column on every encrypted table makes
        rotation to a v2 master key possible without a migration window.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Encryption in transit">
        TLS 1.2+ should terminate at your hosting edge or reverse proxy for
        every public endpoint. Enable HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects and HSTS when
        your production domain is stable.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Authentication">
        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Human sign-in</b> — passwordless email OTP + WebAuthn passkeys.
            No password storage; no password reset email path.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Agent tokens</b> — stored as SHA-256 digests. The plaintext is
            shown exactly once at mint and never again. Revocation is a
            server-side flag that invalidates the row immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Integrator webhooks</b> — outbound calls carry an{' '}
            {`X-Relay-Signature: sha256=…`} header HMAC-ed with the tenant&apos;s
            per-product secret. Integrators MUST verify this before acting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Inbound email</b> — SendGrid Inbound Parse posts to{' '}
            {`/v1/webhooks/email?secret=…`}. Any value mismatch returns 401 and
            drops the payload.
          </li>
        </List>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Audit log">
        Every mutation by an authenticated caller writes an {`audit_log`} row
        with actor, action, target, timestamp, and contextual metadata.
        Supported events include {`signup_create`}, {`key_create`},{' '}
        {`key_reveal`}, {`key_deliver`}, {`account_delete`}, {`tenant_create`},{' '}
        {`admin.raise_signup_limit`}, and all billing state changes. Rows are
        append-only; deletes are prohibited at the application layer.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Rate limits">
        <List>
          <li>
            <b>Per-token API limits</b> — 60 writes/min and 300 reads/min
            (best-effort, per-instance on Vercel Fluid Compute). Designed to
            catch runaway agents rather than act as a hard quota.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Per-user monthly signup cap</b> — default 50/month. Breaches
            are logged and, in enforce mode, return HTTP 429. Ops can raise
            the ceiling per user via the admin API.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Integrator action quota</b> — enforced atomically on dispatch
            for every billable action (signup / reveal / rotate / delete);
            overage queues per-action invoice items for monthly flush.
          </li>
        </List>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Observability">
        Sentry captures unhandled errors and rate-limit breaches; a pino
        structured logger writes JSON to Vercel logs. Sensitive headers
        ({`authorization`}, {`cookie`}) and token fields are redacted before
        leaving the process.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Multi-tenant isolation">
        Every resource row carries {`tenant_id`} and/or {`user_id`}; every
        authenticated route validates both before reading or writing. Cross-
        tenant reads are an automatic test target; we are planning Postgres
        row-level security as a belt-and-suspenders layer post-launch.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Vulnerability reporting">
        Report security issues to {`security@example.com`} (PGP key on
        request). We acknowledge within 48 hours and patch critical issues
        within 7 days. See the full policy in <code>SECURITY.md</code> on
        the repo.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Compliance roadmap">
        We are targeting <b>SOC 2 Type I</b> in Q4 2026 with a Type II report
        to follow the subsequent audit period. GDPR and CCPA data-subject
        rights are honored today; contact {`privacy@example.com`}. A Data
        Processing Agreement (DPA) is available to any paying integrator on
        request.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Source-availability">
        Relay&apos;s full app/server code is open source under AGPL-3.0.
        Hosted SDK-only starter code can remain MIT-licensed. Full, inner, and
        self-hosted generated projects include the Relay app/server and default
        to AGPL-3.0-only so teams can audit, fork, and run their own deployment.
